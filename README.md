# Ashen_Duel_Game
I created this repository so my project can be seen by LittleCandleGames Staff during the hiring process.

Ashen Duel is a small console-based combat simulator written in C#.

## Purpose

This project was created to practice object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism in a game-like scenario.

Rather than using a game engine, I focused on implementing core combat logic in a clean and extendable way.

## Features

- Base Character class
- Warrior and Mage classes
- Turn-based combat loop
- Critical hit mechanic


To run the project:

dotnet build
dotnet run
